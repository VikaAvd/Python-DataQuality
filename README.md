# Python-DataQuality
Python for Data Quality Engineers program. Repository for home tasks

## Home task #1
Create a python script:
    Create list of 100 random numbers from 0 to 1000
    Sort list from min to max without using sort()
    Calculate the average for even and odd numbers
    Print both average result in console
    Each line of code should be commented with description.
Commit script to git repository and provide link as home task result.


## Home task #2
Write a code:

1. create a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)
dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
dict's values should be a number (0-100),
example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]

2. get previously generated list of dicts and create one common dict:
if dicts have same key, we will take max value, and rename key with dict number with max value
if key is only in one dict - take it as is,
example: {'a_1': 5, 'b': 7, 'c': 35, 'g_2': 42}
Each line of code should be commented with description.
Commit script to git repository and provide link as home task result.

2.Provide record type required data
3.Record is published on text file in special format
